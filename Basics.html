To set value 
  SET server:name "your_value"

To get value
  GET server:name // ouput => "your_value"

To delete value
  DEL

To set key if not exist
  SETNX


Auto-increment value
  INCR // It is an atomic operation. 
  
  Scenario
  Client A reads count as 10.
  Client B reads count as 10.
  Client A increments 10 and sets count to 11.
  Client B increments 10 and sets count to 11.
  
  //We wanted the value to be 12, but instead it is 11! 
  //This is because incrementing the value in this way is not an atomic operation. 
  //Calling the INCR command in Redis will prevent this from happening, because it is an atomic operation. 
  //Redis provides many of these atomic operations on different types of data.


Examples
    SET connections 10
    INCR connections => 11
    INCR connections => 12
    DEL connections
    INCR connections => 1
    
Key expiration
  Redis can be told that a key should only exist for a certain length of time. This is accomplished with the EXPIRE and TTL commands.


    SET resource:lock "Redis Demo"
    EXPIRE resource:lock 120
   //This causes the key resource:lock to be deleted in 120 seconds. You can test how long a key will exist with the TTL command. It returns the number of seconds until it will be deleted.


    TTL resource:lock => 113
    // after 113s
    TTL resource:lock => -2
    //The -2 for the TTL of the key means that the key does not exist (anymore). A -1 for the TTL of the key means that it will never expire. Note that if you SET a key, its TTL will be reset.


    SET resource:lock "Redis Demo 1"
    EXPIRE resource:lock 120
    TTL resource:lock => 119
    SET resource:lock "Redis Demo 2"
    TTL resource:lock => -1
    
    
    LIST
      // A list is a series of ordered values. 
      //Some of the important commands for interacting with lists are RPUSH, LPUSH, LLEN, LRANGE, LPOP, and RPOP. 
      //You can immediately begin working with a key as a list, as long as it doesn't already exist as a different type.
      
      
      RPUSH puts the new value at the end of the list.


    RPUSH friends "Alice"
    RPUSH friends "Bob"
   //LPUSH puts the new value at the start of the list.


    LPUSH friends "Sam"
  //LRANGE gives a subset of the list. It takes the index of the first element you want to retrieve as 
  //its first parameter and the index of the last element you want to retrieve as its second parameter.
  //A value of -1 for the second parameter means to retrieve elements until the end of the list.


    LRANGE friends 0 -1 => 1) "Sam", 2) "Alice", 3) "Bob"
    LRANGE friends 0 1 => 1) "Sam", 2) "Alice"
    LRANGE friends 1 2 => 1) "Alice", 2) "Bob"
      
      
    //LLEN returns the current length of the list.


    LLEN friends => 3
    //LPOP removes the first element from the list and returns it.


    LPOP friends => "Sam"
    //RPOP removes the last element from the list and returns it.


    RPOP friends => "Bob"
    //Note that the list now only has one element:


    LLEN friends => 1
    LRANGE friends 0 -1 => 1) "Alice"
